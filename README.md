## Objectives of this project: 
1. According to the operating characteristics of vending machines, analyze the data of operating indicators, merchandising data and market demand, complete the calculation of the indicators of sales volume, inventory and profitability, and draw corresponding charts and predict the sales volume of each vending machine according to the requirements.
2. Label the merchandise sold by each vending machine so that it can show the characteristics of the merchandise sold.

**Task 1 Data Processing and Analysis** 
- Task 1.1 Based on the data in Annex 1, extract the corresponding sales data for each vending machine and save it in a CSV file with the names `task1-1A.csv`, `task1-1B.csv`, ... , `task1-1E.csv`. 
- Task 1.2 Calculate the transaction value and order volume for each vending machine for the month of April 2017 and the total number of transactions and total number of orders for all the vending machines, which are reflected in a table in the NOTEBOOK.
- Task 1.3 Calculate the average transaction value per order and average daily order volume for each vending machine for each month, represented in a table in the notebook .

**Task 2 Data Visualization and Analysis**
- Task 2.1 Plot a bar chart of the top 5 selling items in June 2017 sales.
- Task 2.2 Plot a line graph of total monthly transactions per vending machine and a histogram of the month-on-month growth rate of transactions.
- Task 2.3 Plot a pie chart of gross profit per vending machine as a percentage of total gross profit (assuming a gross profit margin of 25% for beverages and 20% for non-beverages)
- Task 2.4 Plot a bubble chart of transactions per vending machine versus orders for the month of April, with the vending machine number on the horizontal axis and the number of orders per month on the vertical axis.
- Task 2.5 Plot a heat map of **vending machine B**'s order volume for the months of June, July, and August, with the horizontal axis in days and the vertical axis in hours. What conclusions can be drawn from the heat map analysis?

**Task 3 Vending Machine Portrait**
- Task 3.1 Analyze the merchandising data of each vending machine, summarize the pattern and give the labels of the beverage category of each vending machine, and the results are saved in a CSV file The file names are `task3-1A.csv` , `task3-1B.csv` , ... , `task3-1E.csv`, in the format shown in the table below.  !

- Task 3.2 Expand the labeling based on Task 3.1, generate the complete vending machine image results based on the labels and save them in CSV files with the names `task3-2A.csv`, `task3-2B.csv`, ... `task3-2E.csv`. Summarize the description based on this portrait and give marketing advice.

**Task 4 Business Forecasting** The operator of the vending machine has asked the data analyst to forecast the number of transactions per vending machine and has asked you to complete the following questions:
- Task 4.1 What is the rationale for forecasting sales?
